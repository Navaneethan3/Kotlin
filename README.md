     - rules:-
     - get principle amount from user.
     - get start year , end year from user.

     - the compount interest must be calculated on the interest amount if the user did not pay the amount on time and interest on the principal amount must be calculated separately.
     - ask the user whether he paid the anual emi on time.(initially in the development process assume he has not paid on time)
